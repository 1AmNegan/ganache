ZIRCON is an Electron based UI for TestRPC. The goals of the project are:

- Provide an easier path to getting started with Ethereum Blockchain.
- Provide a robust cross-platform Desktop Application that bypasses all of the current cross-platform installation issues some people experience with `ethereum-testrpc`.
- Allows for more complex use cases for `ethereum-testrpc` in a more convienient environment.
